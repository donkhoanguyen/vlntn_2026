Tribute to Mai Pham - from the team at Don Kitchen

Hi Mai,

We want to begin with one simple message:
**Thank you!** 

On this third valentine day since meeting you, Don Kitchen would like to extend our most sincere gratitude. We of course are not offended that you have been choosing other restaurants and kitchen for your filling, no, even though that was very nice of you to keep us hanging. 

With that being said, your love and support have helped us grow, improve, and keep doing what we truly enjoy - making food that Mai Pham can enjoy.

To celebrate this anniversary, we wanted to share the values that have shaped Don Kitchen from the very beginning. These are the three qualities we've always stood for, and the ones we promise to keep carrying forward.
